The theory of reference is, I shall argue, the theory of meaning for certain simple types of language. The only entities needed in the so-called theory of meaning are, in many interesting cases and perhaps even in all cases, merely what is required in order for the expressions of our language to be able to refer in certain more complicated situations. Instead of the theory of reference and the theory of meaning we perhaps ought to speak in some cases of the theory of simple and of multiple reference, respectively. Quine has regretted that the term â€˜semanticsâ€™, which etymologically ought to refer to the theory of meaning, has come to mean the theory of reference.1 I submit that this usage is happier than Quine thinks, and that large parts of the theory of meaning in reality are â€” or ought to be â€” but semantical theories for notions transcending the range of certain elementary types of concepts.},

	abstract = {This book focuses on the relationship between syntax and meaning. Terje Lohndal's core claim is that it is possible to create a transparent mapping from syntax to logical form such that each syntactic Spell-Out domain directly corresponds to a conjunct at logical form. The argument focuses on two domains of grammar - phrase structure and argument structure - and brings together two independently established but seemingly unconnected hypotheses: that verbs do not require arguments, and that specifiers are not required by the grammar. Following the introduction, the second chapter looks in detail at the separation of the verb from its thematic arguments, and presents data from argument structure, reciprocals, and adjectival passives, while the third examines the claim that specifiers do not play a role as the target of various grammatical operations. Chapter 4 then brings these arguments together and proposes a syntax that maps transparently onto logical forms where all thematic arguments are severed from the verb. Moreover, the broader consequences of this approach are outlined in terms of Spell-Out, movement, linearization, thematic uniqueness, and agreement. The book closes with an examination of the relationship between grammatical and conceptual meaning, and a detailed discussion of the nature of compositionality.},

	abstract = {It is a cross-linguistically robust fact that the same modal auxiliaries come in different flavors: epistemic, deontic, ability, teleological... This fact is neatly captured in a system where each modal has a single lexical entry, where the difference in flavor comes from contextually-provided accessibility relations (cf. Lewis 1973, Kratzer 1981). Equally robust, however, are the phenomena that suggest that epistemics and a subset of deontics are interpreted higher than the remaining flavors (subsumed under the label 'root modals'). The goal of this dissertation is to show that a unified analysis of modal auxiliaries is maintainable, while still providing some principled explanation for the relative ordering of tense, aspect and the various modals in Cinque's (1999) hierarchy, based on evidence in French and Italian. To make sense of the relative scope of modals w.r.t. tense and aspect, I start with the empirical puzzle that aspect interacts differently with the various modal flavors. Perfective aspect on roots in French and Italian yields 'actuality entailments' (cf. Bhatt 1999), that is, an uncancelable inference that the proposition expressed by the complement holds in the actual world, and not merely in some possible world(s).},

Its main claim, based on a range of data involving different kinds of distributive inferences in various languages, is that we need a semantic theory of number that allows both morphosyntactically singular {NPs} to be associated with semantically plural individuals (sets), and morphosyntactically plural {NPs} to be associated with semantically singular individuals (atoms). Whether a given {NP} is associated with an atom or a set is determined by both formal and lexical-conceptual factors: specifically, the need to avoid type-mismatches between dubject and predicate, and the degree of animacy of te {NP}'s referent.
This study is of interest to researchers working on the semantics of number and number-related phenomena (in particular distributivity), as well as the influence of animacy on grammar. More generally, it is relevant to anyone interested in the relation between conceptual and formal semantics, and the way that lexical properties of words may influence their behaviour at the compositional level.},

  Abstract                 = {Correlativization seems to be an intrinsicallynon-local strategy, where the Correlative clause can appeardiscontinuous from the noun phrase it modifies. I show that correlative constructions in the Modern Indo-Aryan languages neverthelessdisplay locality effects.The nature of these locality effects depends upon whether the correlativeclause involves a single relativization ('Simple') or mutiplerelativizations ('Multi-Head'). The generalization that emerges is thata Correlative clause must be merged as locally as possible to the phrasethat it modifies. Simple correlatives modify {DPs} and so they startadjoined to the {DP} that they modify and then are fronted to an {IP}-adjoinedposition. Such an approach is able to explain the hitherto unexplainedsensitivity of the correlative-modified phrase relationship to islands.Multi-Head Correlatives modify {IPs} and therefore they start adjoined to the {smallestIP} that contains the variables bound by the Multi-Head Correlative, followedby optional movement to the clause-initial position. My proposal argues that Simple Correlatives and Multi-Head Correlatives involve different derivational histories. This difference in derivationalhistory is then used to account for the many differences in their syntactic behavior. Finally, the 'Condition on Local Merge' from which this analysis follows is shown to have cross-linguistic support.},

  Abstract                 = {Under what conditions are expressions of a language the same; when are they different? Indices and Identity focuses on this question in the context of the theory of anaphora and on the role of indices in characterizing syntactic and semantic identity of expressions.Fiengo and May develop two main themes within the theory of anaphora. The first pertains to the meaning of coindexing and non-coindexing -- the correspondence between indexical relations among expressions and the valuation relation that holds among them -- while the second is the development of Dependency Theory, the theory of the relations of occurrences of indices. The novelty of Fiengo and May's approach lies with their characterization of indexical dependencies and the conditions under which structures manifest the same or different dependency.In particular, Indices and Identity emphasizes issues raised by strict and sloppy identity in ellipsis, exploring what Fiengo and May call "the eliminative puzzles of ellipsis." The significance of these puzzles is that they show the shortcomings of current theories of anaphora in ellipsis, while illustrating an application of Dependency Theory to complex cases of strict and sloppy identity.Elliptical contexts in turn lead to consideration of the embedding of the formal syntactic notions of identity arising from indices and dependencies within more general notions of structural identity. This relates to a consideration of the foundations of reconstruction, which, the authors argue, is syntactic identity up to indexical identity and vehicle change -- variation in the syntactic form of expression of arguments.The book concludes with a discussion of the relation of reconstruction, logical representation in grammar, and the application of grammatical constraints. The discussion focuses on antecedent contained deletion, and stands independently as a comprehensive study of this construction.Linguistic Inquiry Monograph No. 24},

  Abstract                 = {{SQUIBS} {AND} {DISCUSSION} 303 {DP} {IS} {NOT} A {SCOPE} {ISLAND} Uli Sauerland Zentrum fu¨r allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft 1 The Issue This squib is concerned with inverse linking constructions. May (1977) introduced this term for cases where a quantificational {DP} occurs inside another {DP} and takes wider scope than the containing {DP}. The construction is illustrated in (1), where every linguist is an argument of book, but takes wider scope than one book by t on the most salient interpretation. (1) Tom read [{cQP} one book by [{iQP} every linguist]]. In the following, I use the terms {iQP} and {cQP} for the inversely linked, contained {QP} and the containing {QP}, respectively. My use of the two terms is indicated in (1). For concreteness, I furthermore assume that syntactic movement, specifically Quantifier Raising ({QR}), is the only scope-changing mechanism. May (1977) proposed that in inverse linking, the {iQP} (everylinguist in (1)) undergoes {QR} to take clausal scope at {VP} (in the framework May was assuming, the {iQP} actually took scope at S). This {LF} structure is shown in (2). (2) {TP} {VPTom} {DP}1 {VP} every linguist read {DP} one {NP} book {PP} by t1 I am grateful for the useful comments I received on earlier versions of this material from Danny Fox; from audiences at {ESCOL} ’99 at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, at {McGill} University in Montreal, and at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science in Lyon; and from one of the reviewers. The German Research Council ({DFG}) is currently supporting me as an {EmmyNoether}-Fellow (Grant {SA} 925/1-1), and at the time of writing I was enjoying the hospitality of the University of Tokyo and the University of Tsukuba. All remaining errors in this squib are solely my responsibility. 304 {SQUIBS} {AND} {DISCUSSION} Today, however, a different analysis of inverse linking is almost universally accepted. May himself proposes, in his 1985 book, that {DP} is an island for {QR}. The inversely linked interpretation of (1) is, on this proposal, derived from the structure in (3). (3) {TP} {VPTom} read {DP} every linguist {DP}1 {DP} one {NP} book {PP} by t1 Rooth (1985:117–118) and Larson (1985b) propose the same analysis of inverse linking, though with a different scope-taking mechanism. The {DP}-adjunction analysis is also adopted by Heim and Kratzer (1998:232–233) and, with a different scope-taking mechanism, by Barker (2002). May and Bale (2002) provide an accessible discussion of the analyses by May (1985) and Larson (1985b). Representation (3) requires some version of type-shifting to be interpretable since the sister of the {iQP} is of type H20855e, H20855H20855e, {tH}20856, {tH}20856H20856 while {iQP} itself is of type H20855H20855e, {tH}20856, {tH}20856. (Rooth and Heim and Kratzer provide concrete implementations of the type shift.) In this squib, I argue that May’s (1977) {TP}-adjunction analysis of inverse linking is required, which entails that {DP} cannot be an island for {QR}. Specifically, I show that the {iQP} can take scope separate from the {cQP} when scope relative to a scope-taking verb or scope relative to negation is considered. I look at these two phenomena in sections 2 and 3. In section 4, I discuss Larson’s (1985b) finding concerning the scope of {iQP} and {cQP} relative to a third {QP} that is the main argument for the adjunction-to-{DP} analysis. 2 Intensional Verbs The study of examples containing three quantificational elements requires great care. I first introduce the tests for wide and narrow scope {SQUIBS} {AND} {DISCUSSION} 305 of a {QP} relative to the verb want and then apply them to inverse linking. It is well known that indefinites provide a good test for narrow scope relative to an intensional verb. Consider (4). (4) John wants to marry someone from Spain. (4) has two distinct scopal construals. On one reading (sometimes called the de dicto reading), marrying any person from Spain would satisfy John’s desires. This construal allows (4) to be true in a situation where John does not know anybody from Spain. For this reading, the indefinite someone from Spain must take scope below want, since there is no single person such that John holds the desire to...},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues against the view that Hindi has a single strategy of relativization, traditionally referred to as the correlative construction, which is typologically distinct from relativization in languages like English. It is shown that Hindi, in fact, has two types of relative clauses which are syntactically and semantically distinct. Hindi embedded and right-adjoined relative clauses are generated inside {NP} and function like noun modifiers. They are similar in essential respects to restrictive relative clauses in English. Hindi left-adjoined relative clauses, on the other hand, are adjoined to {IP} at D-structure. They do not function like noun modifiers but are quantificational expressions binding variables inside their scope domain. It is suggested that left-adjoined relatives belong typologically with free relatives in English and internally-headed relatives in Quechua, since they have certain significant properties in common with these constructions.},

Based on the proposal that declarative complements of question-embedding predicates are limiting cases of embedded questions, this dissertation presents a compositional-semantic analysis of question embedding sentences that can correctly predict the three kinds of variability above. According to the proposal, the complement selection is determined solely by the semantic type of the embedding predicate. The variability in exhaustivity and veridicality of embedded questions follows from a unified semantic derivation, namely one involving exhaustification at the matrix level once the lexical semantics of the embedding predicate is taken into account.},
