  Abstract                 = {This paper argues against the view that Hindi has a single strategy of relativization, traditionally referred to as the correlative construction, which is typologically distinct from relativization in languages like English. It is shown that Hindi, in fact, has two types of relative clauses which are syntactically and semantically distinct. Hindi embedded and right-adjoined relative clauses are generated inside {NP} and function like noun modifiers. They are similar in essential respects to restrictive relative clauses in English. Hindi left-adjoined relative clauses, on the other hand, are adjoined to {IP} at D-structure. They do not function like noun modifiers but are quantificational expressions binding variables inside their scope domain. It is suggested that left-adjoined relatives belong typologically with free relatives in English and internally-headed relatives in Quechua, since they have certain significant properties in common with these constructions.},
